# Challenge: Refactor the My Places App

The My Places app is working fine, but the code starts to "smell"...ðŸ’©

There is a bunch of components drilling down the `isLarge` state to `PlaceImage` - which is the only component that really needs this information (together with `Header`, where the state gets changed).

Please refactor the app to use React Context to pass the `isLarge` state directly to the components that need it!

## Local development

To run project commands locally, you need to install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

You can then use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start the development server
- `npm run build` to create a production build
- `npm run start` to start the production build
- `npm run test` to run the tests in watch mode (if available)

> ðŸ’¡ This project requires a bundler. You can use `npm run dev` to start the development server. You can then view the project in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The Live Preview Extension for Visual Studio Code will **not** work for this project.
